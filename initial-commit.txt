برای شاخه جدید زدن به جای 
(1) => git branch "name"   and   (2) => git checkout name
میتوان با کد زیر هم branch جدید درست کرد هم واردش شد
=> git checkout -b name
یا
=> git switch -c name
برای حذف کردن branch یا چند تا از branchکافیست 
=> git branch -D name name2


                    ==> Git Stash <== Stash uses when ((UnStaged-changes)) happend
git stash => برگشت به حالت پیش از کامیت(commit)
git stash apply => برگشت به حالتی که بعد از کامیت(commit) تغیرات روی فایل کرده ایم
                 ‍/با این کد به تنهایی به اخرین تغییر دست خواهیم یافت
git stash list => لیست تغیراتی که ما تنها روی working directory   داده ایم یعنی بدون stage کردن  
        ||         در این لیست 0 اخرین تغیر است
        ||

git stash apply number         number which's  in the list 
git stash clear                deletes all the stashes

    More Details :
1)git stash push -m "some text"                        This code can stash chenges with a message that you can
                                                         ,see in (git stash list)
2)git stash pop number (number which's  in the list)   This code can do a same thing like (git stash apply number)
                                                         ,but it will remove the stash number from stash list
3)git stash drop number                                This code will only remove the stash number from stash list  


                     ==>Git Reflog <==
git reflog                     Shows all the logs even those which deleted.                     



                     ==> Git Merge <==At the begining, We have to go to a specific branch that
                                      we want to combine it with another branch
1)git merge another-branch-name             ==> another-branch-name refers to another branch that will be merged 
                                                This code will bring commits in anotherbranch to our branch. 
2)git merge --squash another-branch-neme    ==> This code will bring the changes frome anotherbranch 
                                                to our branch but without the commits and therefor we 
                                                should create a seprate commit which contains all changes.
3)git merge --no-ff another-branch-name    ==> In this code we have all commits from another branch and also
                                               have one new commit called merge commit.  
4)git merge --abort                        ==>When we have conflex merge to undo the merge command
5)git log --merge                          ==>Shows the commits that have contrast(or conflict) together.      
6)git diff                                 ==>Shows more information about commits that are in contrast(or conflict).


                     ==> Git Rebase <== You can watch lesson 54 for know how to use it but just pay attention that
                                        git rebase make new commits.First you should switch to another branch 
                                        for example X and:
{in X }git rebase Y                               ==> Y is a name of the branch we wanna rebase it into our X branch 
                                        And after that we switch to our Y branch and :
{in Y }git merge X                 notice! BE CAREFULL IN USING GIT REBASE  


                     ==> Cherry-Pick <== Allows us to exactly pick one specific commits in a branch and add
                                         it to our branch.
git cherry-pick commit's number          commit's number which we see in git log for example:
                                         df128562a749af0920b8cba83fdbd9576f0bcb67 ; It leads to create a new
                                         commit's number that is exactly have the same order in privious
                                         but pay attention that  these two commits don't have a same number.                                       


                     ==>Git Tag <== The version is like a number for example 2.0 or 1.0 and ... .
1)git tag                            ==>Shows all the tag we have up to now.
2)git tag version commit's namber    ==>Gives a tag to our commit's number.
3)git tag -a version -m "messege"    ==>It uses just for our latest commit in a branch and also gives a 
                                      messege to it.
4)git tag -d version                 ==>To delete the tag.
