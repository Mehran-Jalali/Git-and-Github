git ls-remote         ==>to show list of commits in remote repository.
git fetch ((origin))  ==>fetch the new branches that we have made in origin.


                         ==>Local tracking branch<===

As you know we have: 1-Local branch             =>Branch on your pc

                    *2-Local tracking branch*   =>Local refrence to remote tracking branch(to be edited)
                     CODE available : git push |git pull
                     3-Remote tracking branch   =>Local copy of remote branch(not to be edited) CODE: git fetch <origin>

                     4-Remote branch('origin' repository)  =>Branch in remote location(e.g Git-hub)

To connect "remote tracking branch" to "Local tracking branch":                     
 ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓      
First you might create a branch and therefor: 
git branch --track <name> <remotes/origin/name of branch that be set up>  
                             *notice! <<The name should be based on each other to push and pull easier>>

git branch -vv   ==>Shows the branches that are based on each other and also the normel branches.
